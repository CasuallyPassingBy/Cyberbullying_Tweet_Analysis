# Project
This is a project about classifying cyberbullying tweets using artificial intelligence tools
to clasify cyberbullying tweets. We are using the cyberbullying.csv to train the AI models. 
Additionally we are using streamlit to make a UI to make it interactive, to achieve that we proprocessed the tweets and saved the cleaned tweets to generate
wordcoulds to visualize the frequency of words. The cleaned tweets have been stored in cyberbullyin_tweets_wordclouds.csv.
